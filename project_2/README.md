# REACT MODULE - TDD PROJECT 2

[Project 2](project2) builds on the first project, introduces `jest` as a test framework and explores some testing tools

### Resources
- A [glossary](glossary.md) of terms. Continue to add terms and definitions that you come across.

# Project 2

##### Learning Objective
- Explain some common testing tools for react

##### Challenge Steps
- [1. Jest](jest.md)
- [2. Testing Library - React](react-testing-library.md)
- [2. Testing Library - UserEvent](user-event.md)
- [4. React Test Renderer](react-test-renderer.md)

Once you've finished, repeat it, or keep playing around. Play around with `react-dom`, `enzyme`, `cypress`.

NB: We prefer `react-testing-library` to `enzyme`. The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
